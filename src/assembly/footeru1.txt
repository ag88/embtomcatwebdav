I've made efforts to tailor the WebDAV servlet so that it works as a standalone app. 
Developing this has taken quite some effort mainly in adding features,  
getting it to work and rather extensive tests.         
If you use this app and found it useful, I'd really appreciate it if you could support 
my efforts <a href="https://donorbox.org/embedded-tomcat-webdav-server">
